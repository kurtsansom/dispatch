Radiative Transfer
==================

Several radiative transfer solvers are implemented in DISPATCH, but most of
them are still under development, and they are therefore not included in the
public release.

The implementation and functionality of RT solvers will be described below,
starting with one that is initially intended for stellar atmosphere work,
while using a technique that is easily generalized to any geometry.
