Documentation
-------------

Several example of how to access and visualize DISPATCH data are given
in the :ref:`jupyter` section.

The module APIs are self-documented, using the standard Python documentation
mechanisms, cf.
::

   help(dispatch)
   help(dispatch.select)
   dispatch.snapshot(<TAB>

The source code may be found in ``utilities/python/dispatch/``, and is
also available via the :ref:`auto-generated documentation <doxy>` (the
"Files" menu contains source code).
