Python support
==============

It is highly recommended to use Anaconda as the Python 3 installation, adding also
Spyder, and installing the add-on that allows running Jupyter Notebooks inside Spyder.

To import Python modules, add the full path of the DISPATCH directory ``utilities/python/``
to the Python path (see :ref:`environment`), and do::

   import dispatch
   import dispatch.select
   import dispatch.graphics
   import dispatch.yt
