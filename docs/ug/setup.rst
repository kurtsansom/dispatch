Installing
==========

To clone a working copy of the code from Bitbucket, do
::

   git clone https://aanordlund@bitbucket.org/aanordlund/dispatch.git

To work with GIT behind a firewall -- including cloning -- see the link below.

To contribute back to the repository, use pull requests from a branch,
or (better) setup a fork on Bitbucket (search for "Forking a repository" 
on `Bitbucket Support <https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/>`_), 
and make pull requests from the fork.

To get direct write access (mainly for core developers and collaborators), setup
an account on Bitbucket if you don't have one, and ask to be added to the access list.
Then use the URL ``git@bitbucked.org:aanordlund/dispatch`` to clone or fork.
