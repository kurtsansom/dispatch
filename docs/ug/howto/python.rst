python/*.{py,ipynb} files
=========================

This is where to put the *experiment specific* Python files.

Functionalities that may be used in any context should instead
be added to ``utilities/python/``, or should be amended to for
example ``utilities/python/dispatch/_dispatch.py`` or other
files there.

For details about data access via Python, see the `Data Access`_ section.
