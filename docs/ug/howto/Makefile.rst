Makefile
====================

The ``Makefile`` should initially be copied from another experiment
directory, and usually requires only minor editing, of mostly obvious
nature -- such as choosing a different solver, changing the default
compilation options, and adding or modifying the ``extras_mod.o:``
dependencies.
