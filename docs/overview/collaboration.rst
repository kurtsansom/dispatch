Collaborations
--------------

We welcome collaborations, in which we give access to the development
version of DISPATCH, or provide support in connection with use of the
public repository. Such collaborations are expected to result in
contributions in the form of added solvers and/or experiment setups.
After some time, such additions are expected to migrate to the public
repository.

In most cases such collaborative development efforts run smoothest if
forks of the development repository (or possibly of the public repository)
are used, with pull requests used to merge validated and stable methods
into the main repository.

In cases where our contributions to use of DISAPTCH are significant,
those of us that participate also may expect co-authorship.
