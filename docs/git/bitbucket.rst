Bitbucket account
----------------------

To use the ssh: method behind a firewall you need to have an account at bitbucket.org (useful in any case).
After registering, use ``ssh-keygen`` on the cluster frontend to create an SSH key. Then 
use the "A" icon in the lower left corner of the bitbucket web page to access "Bitbucket
Settings" and "SSH keys", and store the public (.pub) part of the key there.
