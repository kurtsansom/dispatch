Bitbucket account
----------------------

To create your own repository, or a fork, or to use the ssh: method behind a firewall,
you need to have an account at bitbucket.org.

After registering, use ``ssh-keygen`` on the cluster frontend to create an SSH key. Then 
use the "A" icon in the lower left corner of the bitbucket web page to access "Bitbucket
Settings" and "SSH keys", and store the public (.pub) part of the key there.
