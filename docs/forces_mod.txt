Forces are now part of the extras_mod, so to add forcing take a copy
of extras/extras_mod.f90 into the experiemtn/xxx/ dir, and uncomment
the lines marked ! forces.

The new forces_mod do NOT collide with the old force_mod modules, so
one can construct new forces_mod modules by using force%selected to
load values into patch%force_per_unit_mass.

However, in the future forces_mod.f90 files should be written directly,
since this alleviates the need to stick to a definitive (and long) argument 
list for the force%selected functions.
