GIT forks
---------

A GIT fork is a GIT repository (e.g. at bitbucket.org), which is created as a copy
of another repository, and which maintains a two-way connection, via which one can
propagats updates both from and to the original.

Read about forks for example at the
`Bitbucket web site <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/forking-a-repository-221449527.html>`_.

We suggest that you create a fork of the public repository on bitbucket.org,
and work with private working copies of your fork, on laptops, as well as on clusters.

You may want (other) studentents to do the same or, alternatively, make a fork of your fork,
to get an arrangement such as this one:::

         private_version
              |         \
       public_version    private_forks
        /     |   |  \
     Ralph   Rolf |  Others...
       |          |
    student   student


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4
