Comments
--------------

Comment in procedures should be either multi-line:::

   !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ! The dashed lines should end in column 80
   !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or single-line:::

   !--- This is a single line comment ---

Blank lines should be avoided (to maximize the visible code in editor windows), but if
deemed absolutely essential to increase readability, they should have a leading comment
sign, flush with surrounding lines (to allow fast skipping to the next procedure in editors):::

   code ...
   !
   code ..


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4
