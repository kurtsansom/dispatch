Setup
======

To clone a working copy of the code from Bitbucket, do

  git clone https://aanordlund@bitbucket.org/aanordlund/dispatch.git

To contribute back to the repository, use pull requests from a branch,
or setup a fork on Bitbucket, and make pull requests from the fork.

To get direct write access (mainly for core developers), setup an account
on Bitbucket if you don't have one, and ask to be added to the access list.
Then use the URL ``git@bitbucked.org:aanordlund/ispatch`` to clone or fork.
