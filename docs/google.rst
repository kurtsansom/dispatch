Google docs
========================

Google docs allow documentation containing tables, drawing, graphics,
and animations, and makes it easy to collect, edit and maintain such
documents.  This is much more efficient and simple than creating such
documentation as part of the auto-generated HTML hierarchy, which is
exclusively based on the GIT repository contents.
