*.nml input files
====================

``input.nml`` is a template input file, which serves a dual purpose:

1. Define a simple test case, that should not take more than about a minute
   to run on an average laptop
2. Act as a template file, to be copied to input files ``whatever.nml`` whose names
   also define the location of output files, which appear in ``data/whatever/``
   directories.  Here ``whatever`` may be chosen arbitrarily, and could for
   example be ``run1``, ``run2``, or ``2019-08-22a``, or ``L=30px_levels=6-9``.
